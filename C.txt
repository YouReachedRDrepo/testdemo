Hey i'm txt file created in feature 1 from master

now if i switch to master then i shouldnt see these changes


i added this in feature1 but didnt commit, meanwhile checkout master and committed here. now file disappeared from feature1 staged and committed in master

let me try this again. lets be unfair with master this time. D.txt is staged in master but committed in feature1

this is exclusive in feature1a

now added line 12 for 2 commits in feature1a


i added this linein class and pushed to remote
